# VoodooPad Journal

A collection of JSTalk scripts for [VoodooPad](https://plausible.coop/voodoopad/) to add journal features to it.

## Installation

Copy the scripts or check out the Git repo to `~/Library/Application Support/VoodooPad/Script PlugIns` and restart VoodooPad.

## Usage

The idea is to have a daily page named `YYYY-MM-DD` and drop in everything you need.

- `Option-Command-J` creates a new page (or opens it, if it already exists) with the current date
- `Option-Command-I` creates/opens an index page named "Journal Index" and builds an overview of all current journal pages
- `Option-Command-P` searches for the previous journal page
- `Option-Command-N` searches for the next journal page

See menu "Plugin > Journal" as a reminder for these shortcuts.

You can use your document like you normaly would, just keep in mind that the scripts overwrite and/or use every page
falling under these naming conventions.
